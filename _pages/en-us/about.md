<h3>Mabuhay!</h3>

As a research analyst with 8+ years of experience in data analytics, data science and financial research, I combine quantitative and qualitative analyses to draw conclusions from raw data and help clients make fact-based business and investment decisions.

I pioneered the expansion of S&P Global's global wireless research coverage in Asia-Pacific. My research coverage include regulatory and policymaking, industry projections (MNO/MVNO, 5G, towers and small cells) and consumer surveys.

My research has been cited by some of Asia-Pacific's leading financial publications. I have also been invited as a speaker in several international wireless industry conferences.

Apart from being a research analyst, I also do freelance professional translations. I also enjoy travelling. I have been to 27 countries and territories in Africa, Asia and Europe. I also do amateur photography during my travels.
